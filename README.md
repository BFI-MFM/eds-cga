The software is written in Matlab and consists of three folders: 

- "MultiCountryModel" 
- "OneCountryModel"
- "NewKeynesianModel"

These folders contain the code for solving the three applications 
described in the article "Merging simulation and projection approaches 
to solve high-dimensional problems with an application to a new 
Keynesian model" by Lilia Maliar and Serguei Maliar (2015), Quantitative 
Economics 6/1, pages 1–47 (henceforth, MM, 2015). 

Also, the software contains three illustrative examples of applications of 
the cluster grid method, epsilon distinguishable set and adaptive epsilon 
distinguishable set method: 

- RunMeExampleCluster.m
- RunMeExampleEDS.m
- RunMeExampleLocallyAdaptiveEDS.m

The examples use the following files: 

- Density.m
- Cluster.m
- EDS.m 
- LocallyAdaptiveEDS.m
