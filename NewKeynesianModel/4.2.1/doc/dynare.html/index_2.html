<h2 class="section">1.1 What is Dynare ?</h2>

<p>Dynare is a software platform for handling a wide class of economic
models, in particular dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE)
and overlapping generations (OLG) models. The models solved by Dynare
include those relying on the <i>rational expectations</i> hypothesis, wherein
agents form their expectations about the future in a way consistent
with the model. But Dynare is also able to handle models where
expectations are formed differently: on one extreme, models where
agents perfectly anticipate the future; on the other extreme, models
where agents have limited rationality or imperfect knowledge of the
state of the economy and, hence, form their expectations through a
learning process. In terms of types of agents, models solved by Dynare
can incorporate consumers, productive firms, governments, monetary
authorities, investors and financial intermediaries. Some degree of
heterogeneity can be achieved by including several distinct classes of
agents in each of the aforementioned agent categories.
</p>
<p>Dynare offers a user-friendly and intuitive way of describing these
models. It is able to perform simulations of the model given a
calibration of the model parameters and is also able to estimate these
parameters given a dataset. In practice, the user will write a text
file containing the list of model variables, the dynamic equations
linking these variables together, the computing tasks to be performed
and the desired graphical or numerical outputs.
</p>
<p>A large panel of applied mathematics and computer science techniques
are internally employed by Dynare: multivariate nonlinear solving and
optimization, matrix factorizations, local functional approximation,
Kalman filters and smoothers, MCMC techniques for Bayesian estimation,
graph algorithms, optimal control, &hellip;
</p>
<p>Various public bodies (central banks, ministries of economy and
finance, international organisations) and some private financial
institutions use Dynare for performing policy analysis exercises and
as a support tool for forecasting exercises. In the academic world,
Dynare is used for research and teaching purposes in postgraduate
macroeconomics courses.
</p>
<p>Dynare is a free software, which means that it can be downloaded free
of charge, that its source code is freely available, and that it can
be used for both non-profit and for-profit purposes. Most of the
source files are covered by the GNU General Public Licence (GPL)
version 3 or later (there are some exceptions to this, see the file
&lsquo;<tt>license.txt</tt>&rsquo; in Dynare distribution). It is available for the
Windows, Mac and Linux platforms and is fully documented through a
user guide and a reference manual. Part of Dynare is programmed in
C++, while the rest is written using the
<a href="http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/">MATLAB</a> programming
language.  The latter implies that commercially-available MATLAB
software is required in order to run Dynare. However, as an
alternative to MATLAB, Dynare is also able to run on top of
<a href="http://www.octave.org">GNU Octave</a> (basically a free clone of
MATLAB): this possibility is particularly interesting for students or
institutions who cannot afford, or do not want to pay for, MATLAB and
are willing to bear the concomitant performance loss.
</p>
<p>The development of Dynare is mainly done at
<a href="http://www.cepremap.ens.fr">Cepremap</a> by a core team of
researchers who devote part of their time to software
development. Currently the development team of Dynare is composed of
Stéphane Adjemian (Université du Maine, Gains and Cepremap), Houtan
Bastani (Cepremap), Michel Juillard (Banque de France), Frédéric
Karamé (Université d&rsquo;Évry, Epee and Cepremap), Junior Maih (Norges
Bank), Ferhat Mihoubi (Université d&rsquo;Évry, Epee and Cepremap), George
Perendia, Marco Ratto (JRC) and Sébastien Villemot (Cepremap and Paris
School of Economics). Financial support is provided by Cepremap,
Banque de France and DSGE-net (an international research network for
DSGE modeling). Increasingly, the developer base is expanding, as
tools developed by researchers outside of Cepremap are integrated into
Dynare.
</p>
<p>Interaction between developers and users of Dynare is central to the
project. A <a href="http://www.dynare.org/phpBB3">web forum</a> is available
for users who have questions about the usage of Dynare or who want to
report bugs. Training sessions are given through the Dynare Summer
School, which is organized every year and is attended by about 40
people. Finally, priorities in terms of future developments and
features to be added are decided in cooperation with the institutions
providing financial support.
